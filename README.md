# haxxor-framework
Fuzzing, Scanning, Privilege Escalation, and Post-Exploitation framework. Written 100% in Python 2.7 for Linux/Mac OS
## How to use haxxor-framework
##First, install needed requirements by running:
  ```bash
  pip install -r REQUIREMENTS
  ```
  If anymore modules are needed, post an issue so they can be added to the REQUIREMENTS file

##Second, make sure you are running as root (Mac/Linux)

For Ubuntu it would be:
  ```bash
  sudo python #downloadpath/setup.py
  
  sudo haxxor
  ```
  And if you want to uninstall:
  ```bash
  sudo python uninstall.py
  ```
  This moves the directories back to the haxxor-framework directory for easy reinstallation.
  
Mac (same as Ubuntu)

Kali Linux (or any distro running out of box root)
  ```bash
  python #downloadpath/setup.py
  
  haxxor
  ```
  And if you want to uninstall
  ``` bash
  python uninstall.py
  ```
  This moves the directories back to the haxxor-framework directory for easy reinstallation.
